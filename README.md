##### 1. CDD Commit Driven Development

I love use git form improve my learning experience. For this, I follow a simple rule for build this project using a version control system: make significant commits.

So I categorized the content in **Super Rentals tutorial** in 11 steps:

1. Creating an Ember App
2. Planning
3. Routes and templates
4. Model Hook
5. Addons
6. Simple Component
7. Handlebars Helper
8. Ember Data
9. Complex Componento
10. Services
11. Nested Routes

So every commit made here have the step at the begginig of the commit sentence ( 2/Planning, 5/Addons, 10/Services ) and then I described the particular step: adding a simple component, adding an integration test, etc.

I decided use this git learning workflow for create a simple timeline, and when I decide understand an specific step I only should make a **git show** to the commit which contains the step.

- The test are useful but in this case you have to know how it works before, because the testing tools have their own syntax and if you don't know nothing about it will be difficult to understand. It's add more complex, because you will have to learn Ember and how to test it.

- There are inconsistencies in some contents and titles, for example in "Installing Addons" the chapter is about how to install some addons, but the second part is about Ember Mirage", maybe here we have make some differences between installing an addon and then use Ember Mirage. The same for "Building a complex component" because if you are a beginner you will be waiting for know how to build a complex component, but instead of make only this you will read about how to make a component and a controller. Maybe this could be better if we modify the titles, or make more steps for show every Ember concept.

- I think that if you didn't know a previous js framework, learn ember will be very difficult (this was my case). Because it's complex understand how some part of ember interact, this is the case of the routes, components, controllers, and services. In this case is difficult to know why a controller isn't the same as a component, or why a componenc could be used in othe component. I know that this is very important information, but I think that this could be explain with more detail and more focus.

- In genera I see this tutorial for intermediate js developers, not for begginers.
